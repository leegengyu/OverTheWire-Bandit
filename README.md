# OverTheWire-Bandit
This repository contains a walkthrough guide to completing the Bandit levels in the OverTheWire wargames.

This repository serves as:
1) Documentation of my methods and thought process as I solve the Bandit level challenges from OverTheWire wargames.
2) Revision guide based on the key takeaways from solving each challenge.

Each level of the walkthrough guide summarises the:
1) Level Goal (taken verbatim from #insert link to OverTheWire page#)
2) Key Takeaways
3) Alternatives (if any)
4) Common misconceptions (if any)

**Tip**: For those using the Windows Command Prompt to ssh into each level's server, you can right-click on the cmd after copying the password unlocked from the previous level. The right-click pastes the password which was copied. Using the normal shortcut keys to paste (CTRL+V or SHIFT+INSERT) did not work for me.

# Walkthrough Guide
**Bandit Level 0 → Level 1**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to log into a server using SSH from a command-line terminal.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.  
* File: readme  
* Password for Level 1: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

**Bandit Level 1 → Level 2**   
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to read files with special characters, which is "-" in this case.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.  
* File: -  
* Password for Level 2: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9  

**Bandit Level 2 → Level 3**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to read files with spaces in its file name.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.  
* Command: cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename  
* Alternatives: cat "spaces in this filename"  
* File: spaces in this filename  
* Password for Level 3: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

**Bandit Level 3 → Level 4**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to see all files in a directory, by using the -a (--all) argument to the ls command.  
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.  
* File: .hidden  
* Password for Level 4: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

**Bandit Level 4 → Level 5**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to discover the type of a file, by using the file command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.  
* Command: file ./-file*  
* Note: human-readable file means a file with only ASCII text in this context.  
* File: -file07  
* Password for Level 5: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

**Bandit Level 5 → Level 6**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to find a targeted file given a set of properties, by using the find command.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
human-readable  
1033 bytes in size  
not executable  
* Command: find -type f -readable ! -executable -size 1033c  
* Alternative: find -size 1033c (go straight for the most distinguishing property out of all the ones listed; this works in this context only because there was only 1 file which was 1033 bytes in size)  
* Note: suffix 'c' is found after 1033 to specify the units to be bytes. The command will not work if no units were stated.
* Note: optional to include a '.' (dot) after the find command and before specifying the type, to indicate that all directories and files are being searched.  
* Additional practice: learn how to find files of size greater than or less than a given size.
* File: maybehere07/.file2
* Password for Level 6: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

**Bandit Level 6 → Level 7**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to .  
The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
owned by user bandit7  
owned by group bandit6  
33 bytes in size
* Note: Since it is stated that the password is stored somewhere on the server, we must first navigate to the root folder. cd .. twice from the home directory, and then pwd to verify that we are in the root directory. We should only see the slash ('/') character from running pwd.
* Command: find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
* File: ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
* Password for Level 7: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

File: data.txt  
Password for Level 11: IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

**Bandit Level 11 → Level 12**

**Key Takeaways**: learn how to .  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!).  
* File: data8.tar  
* Password for Level 13: 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
