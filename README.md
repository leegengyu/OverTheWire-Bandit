# OverTheWire-Bandit
This repository contains a walkthrough guide to completing the Bandit levels in the OverTheWire wargames.

This repository serves as:
1) Documentation of my methods and thought process as I solve the Bandit level challenges from OverTheWire wargames.
2) Revision guide based on the key takeaways from solving each challenge.

Each level of the walkthrough guide summarises the:
1) Level Goal (taken verbatim from #insert link to OverTheWire page#)
2) Key Takeaways
3) Alternatives (if any)
4) Common misconceptions (if any)

**Tip**: For those using the Windows Command Prompt to ssh into each level's server, you can right-click on the cmd after copying the password unlocked from the previous level. The right-click pastes the password which was copied. Using the normal shortcut keys to paste (CTRL+V or SHIFT+INSERT) did not work for me.

# Walkthrough Guide
**Bandit Level 0 → Level 1**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to log into a server using SSH from a command-line terminal.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.  
* File: readme
* Password for Level 1: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

**Bandit Level 1 → Level 2**   
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to read files with special characters, which is "-" in this case.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.  
* File: -
* Password for Level 2: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

**Bandit Level 2 → Level 3**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to read files with spaces in its file name.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.  
* Command: cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
* Alternatives: cat "spaces in this filename"
* File: spaces in this filename
* Password for Level 3: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

**Bandit Level 3 → Level 4**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to see all files in a directory, by using the -a (--all) argument to the ls command.  
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.  
* File: .hidden
* Password for Level 4: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

**Bandit Level 4 → Level 5**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to discover the type of a file, by using the file command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.  
* Command: file ./-file*
* Note: human-readable file means a file with only ASCII text in this context.
* File: -file07
* Password for Level 5: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

**Bandit Level 5 → Level 6**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to find a targeted file given a set of properties, by using the find command.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
human-readable  
1033 bytes in size  
not executable  
* Command: find -type f -readable ! -executable -size 1033c
* Alternative: find -size 1033c (go straight for the most distinguishing property out of all the ones listed; this works in this context only because there was only 1 file which was 1033 bytes in size)
* Note: suffix 'c' is found after 1033 to specify the units to be bytes. The command will not work if no units were stated.
* Note: optional to include a '.' (dot) after the find command and before specifying the type, to indicate that all directories and files are being searched.
* Additional practice: learn how to find files of size greater than or less than a given size.
* File: maybehere07/.file2
* Password for Level 6: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

**Bandit Level 6 → Level 7**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to find a targeted file given a set of properties, by using the find command (similar to previous one, except with a different set of search criteria).  
The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
owned by user bandit7  
owned by group bandit6  
33 bytes in size
* Note: Since it is stated that the password is stored somewhere on the server, we must first navigate to the root folder. cd .. twice from the home directory, and then pwd to verify that we are in the root directory. We should only see the slash ('/') character from running pwd.
* Command: find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
* Note: There are a lot of files which match the given property, but all of these files (except one) cannot be accessed, as seen from the string of "Permission denied" messages displayed. Only one search result does not have this message.
* File: ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
* Password for Level 7: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

**Bandit Level 7 → Level 8**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to search for a specific word within a file, by using the grep command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.  
* Command: grep millionth data.txt
* File: data.txt
* Password for Level 8: cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

**Bandit Level 8 → Level 9**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to search within a file given a set of criteria, by using the sort and uniq commands, in addition to piping within the terminal.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.  
* Command: cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
* Note: -u argument indicates to print only the unique lines.
* File: data.txt
* Password for Level 9: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

**Bandit Level 9 → Level 10**   
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to search for strings within a file that does not contain only ASCII characters, by using the strings and grep command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters.  
* Note: Running the file data.txt command tells us that the file is a data file, and does not contain only ASCII text. Hence, it was mentioned that there are only a few human-readable strings.
* Command: strings data.txt | grep ===
* File: data.txt
* Password for Level 10: truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

**Bandit Level 10 → Level 11**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to decode base64 encoded data, using the base64 command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.  
* Command: base64 -d data.txt
* Note: -d argument indicates decoding of data.
* File: data.txt
* Password for Level 11: IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

**Bandit Level 11 → Level 12**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to transform strings, using the tr command.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.  
* Command: cat data.txt | tr A-Za-z N-ZA-Mn-za-m
* Note: Inverted commas or square brackets around the parameters of the tr command are not required.
* File: data.txt
* Password for Level 12: 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu

**Bandit Level 12 → Level 13**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to convert hexdump files and extract compressed files, using the xxd and various (de)compression utility commands respectively.  
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!).  
* Step 1: First, make a new directory of your choice under /tmp. Next, copy data.txt to this new directory. There is no need to rename it in my opinion since I felt that I had to remember one more different file name to keep track of where I started.
* Step 2: The file command would state data.txt as a file with ASCII text, but if you view the file contents, it is actually a hex dump. Command to convert the hexdump into binary: xxd -r data.txt > newdata.txt
* Step 3: file newdata.txt shows us that the converted hexdump contains gzip compressed data. Using gunzip to unzip the gzip compressed data gives an error of unknown suffix -- ignored, because the file extension is .txt, which does not match what gunzip is looking for (which is .tar.gz). Hence, rename the file with mv newdata.txt newdata.tar.gz. Then, run gunzip newdata.tar.gz, which gives newdata.tar.
* Step 4: file newdata.tar shows us that the file was compressed with bzip2. However, this file extension does not match what bunzip2 is looking for (which is .bz2). Hence, rename the file with mv newdata.tar newdata.bz2. Then, run bunzip2 newdata.bz2, which gives newdata.
* Step 5: file newdata shows us that the file was compressed with gzip. Rename the file using mv newdata newdata.tar.gz to give the file the appropriate file extension. Run gunzip newdata.tar.gz to get newdata.tar.
* Step 6: file newdata.tar shows us that the file was compressed with POSIX tar. Run tar -xf newdata.tar to get data5.bin. The -x parameter tells tar to extract the files, while the -f parameter tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.
* Step 7: file data5.bin shows us that the file was compressed with POSIX tar. Run tar -xf data5.bin to get data6.bin.
* Step 8: file data6.bin shows us that the file was compressed with bzip2. Rename the file with mv data6.bin data6.bz2. Run bunzip2 data6.bz2 to get data6.
* Step 9: file data6 shows us that the file was compressed with POSIX tar. Run tar -xf data6 to get data8.bin. No need to rename data6 to data6.tar before running the tar command.
* Step 10: file data8.bin shows us that the file was compressed with gzip. Rename the file using mv data8.bin data8.tar.gz. Run gunzip data8.tar.gz to get data8.tar.
* Step 11: file data8.tar shows us that the file contains only ASCII text, which is the password to the next level.
* File: data8.tar
* Password for Level 13: 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

**Bandit Level 13 → Level 14**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to log in to a server using a SSH (RSA) private key, using the ssh command.  
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.  
* Command: ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
* Note: -i parameter of ssh is referring to an identity file, from which the identity key (private key) for authentication is read.
* Note: If I am not wrong, finding the IP address of localhost would require the execution of ifconfig, which is not found on the server. Thus, in place of knowing and using the localhost IP address, we can simply use the hostname itself.
* File: sshkey.private
* Password for Level 14: unknown at this point in time (use command to log into Level 14's server)

**Bandit Level 14 → Level 15**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to send data to another host, using the telnet command.  
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.  
* Command: telnet localhost 30000, 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
* Note: As mentioned in the previous level, the password for this level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14.
* Password for Level 14: 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
* Note: Telnet connection will be closed by host after 1 try of the password.
* Password for Level 15: BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr

**Bandit Level 15 → Level 16**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to send data to another host using SSL encryption, using the openssl and s_client commands.  
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.  
Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…
* Command: openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001, BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
* Note: **Not sure what the helpful note given is referring to**.
* Note: Sending the password of the current level using the telnet command results in the connecting host closing its connection immediately.
* Password for Level 16: cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd

**Bandit Level 16 → Level 17**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to identify listening ports within a server, using the nmap, openssl and s_client command.  
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.  
* Command 1: nmap -A -p 31000-32000 localhost
* Note: -A parameter to nmap enables OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
* Note/Alternative: Executing nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost alone will show that only 1 TCP port, numbered 31790 is open and running unknown service. Run the same command with the -A parameter to confirm that the port speaks SSL. **Need to specify scan type used? e.g. -ST for TCP connect scan**
* Command 2: openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790, cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
* Note: SSH (RSA) private key for next level is given from the SSL connection. Copy and paste the key into a file created in /tmp directory.
* Command 3: chmod 400 <SSH key filename>
* Note: Command 3 sets the permissions of the key file to be readable only by the owner of the file (which is bandit16). Without changing the permissions of the SSH key file will result in the private key being ignored, because the server deems that the permissions for the file are too open, and requires that the file is not accessible to others.
* Command 4: ssh -i <SSH key filename> bandit17@localhost
* Password for Level 17: unknown at this point in time (use command to log into Level 17's server)

**Bandit Level 17 → Level 18**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to compare the contents of 2 files, using the diff command.  
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new.  
NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19.
* Command: diff passwords.old passwords.new
* Note: The output of the diff command is dependent on the order of the parameters supplied to the command. If passwords.new is the second parameter, the second string that is printed in the output is the password for the next level.
* Password for Level 17: xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn (execute more /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17)
* Password for Level 18: kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd

**Bandit Level 18 → Level 19**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to log in to a server via SSH without running .bash files (e.g. .bashrc and .bash_logout), using the ssh command with a set of parameters.  
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the home directory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.
* When we attempt to log in to this level using our normal method, i.e. ssh with just the additional parameter of the port number, we find that the connection is instantly closed by the connecting server. Thus, we need to find a way to prevent the instant termination of connection.
* The exit system call is likely to have been executed. Here, we consider to use another shell instead of the standard one, as the exit system call is likely to have been automated via a script that is local to the shell being used (though it is possible that each other shell also has this automated exit call).
* Command to log in to this level: ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t /bin/sh
* Note: -t parameter in the command forces pseudo-terminal allocation. /bin/sh is another kind of Unix shell. Thus, this command runs /bin/sh (*not entirely sure if .bash files are executed, and then /bin/sh is executed, or the case where the .bash files are never executed, or some other case*), preventing us from being logged out immediately upon a successful login.
* Note: Upon successful login, we observe that each line begins with only a '$' symbol without any prefix such as the green-coloured "bandit18@bandit: $" which we would expect. The wall of welcome text by OverTheWire is also missing. These differences are due to .bash files not running because of the customised ssh command with the stated parameters.
* Note: In this case, the last 2 lines in .bashrc are responsible for logging the user out immediately upon successful login.
* Password for Level 19: IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x

**Bandit Level 19 → Level 20**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to take on the role of another user, using a setuid binary.  
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
* Command: ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
* Note: Executing file bandit20-do shows us that the file is a setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable. Running the command allows us to take on the role of user bandit20 temporarily, because of the setuid (set user ID) executable.
* Password for Level 20: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j

**Bandit Level 20 → Level 21**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to open a listening port and communicate using it, using the nc command.  
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).  
NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think.
* Command: nc -z -v localhost 1-50000 (to find out what are the ports that are currently open)
* From the command, 7 ports are shown to be open. They are port number 22, 113, 30000, 30001, 30002, 30003 and 31790.
* Command (on terminal A): nc -l -p 1234, GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j 
* Note: -l flag means listen mode.
* Note: Any other port number besides 1234 can be used, so long as the number is not an existing port which was already shown to be open (i.e. not one of the 7 listed ones above).
* Optional command (on terminal B): nc -z -v localhost 1234 (to test that the port 1234 had indeed been opened and is listening; However, if this command is used, then the listening side will end the connection after that and the command on terminal A has to be executed again)
* Command (on terminal B): ./suconnect 1234
* The password for Level 21 will then be printed on terminal B.
* I was initially confused by the level goal's description of "It then reads a line of text", thinking that reading a line of text is from the user input into the suconnect application.
* **How this entire level actually works**: open a listening port of our choice and send level 20's password to the suconnect, who will verify that the current level's password is correct, before the setuid bit kicks in and permissions are temporarily elevated to user bandit21 to obtain the next level's password.
* Note: Port scanning done using nc done at different points in time resulted in additional ports being shown to be open. These ports' are normally in the 35000 to 40000+ range, and appear to be open only momentarily for some reason(?).
* Note: -z means that the zero-I/O mode is used, i.e. nc only does scanning. -v means verbose.
* Note: Running the same command without the -v flag returns us no results at all.
* Note: Running the same command without specifying a range of ports results in a result stating that there are no ports to connect to. I think that only some common ports are scanned if no specific range is specified by the user.
* Note: The man page states that the use of the -v flag twice means more verbose. This actually means that the result of each individual port's scan is printed. Having only one -v flag results in only open port results being printed.
* Password for Level 21: gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr

**Bandit Level 21 → Level 22**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to read shell scripts that form part of a cron job.  
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
* First, navigate to /etc/cron.d as mentioned, and we can see that there are 3 cronjobs for the next 3 levels respectively. These are ASCII text files. Open cronjob_bandit22 since it is the next level that we are tackling.
* One of the commands suggested for use in this level is crontab, and from the man page of crontab, we notice that the format of the crontab command fits the contents of the file cronjob_bandit22. The crontab file tells us that there is a shell script that is executed once every time the server is started up (as seen from @reboot).
* Note: A crontab file has 5 fields at the start of the line to specify minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week, which is why we  notice that there is a second line in the crontab that is similar to the first line, except that there are 5 astericks instead of @reboot. The asterick operator specifies all possible values for the 5 fields.
* Note: @reboot is a special string alongside other special strings such as @monthly, @weekly, @daily which denotes that the shell script would be run once every specified period. This increases readability instead of having to manually specify numbers for the 5 fields.
* **Question: Why are 2 lines required in the crontab? Wouldn't it suffice to have the 2nd line only?**
* From the crontab,  We find that there is a shell script within /usr/bin that redirects its output to /dev/null, a null device that discards the information written to it.
* Open cronjob_bandit22.sh in /usr/bin and we find that the password to the next level has been also redirected into a file t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv at /tmp, in addition to the usual location at /etc/bandit_pass where all the passwords are found.
* Password for Level 22: Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI

**Bandit Level 22 → Level 23**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to modify shell scripts that form part of a cron job.  
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.  
NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
* First, navigate to /etc/cron.d as mentioned and open cronjob_bandit23.
* Next, open cronjob_bandit23.sh in /usr/bin. From the shell script, we observe that the destination of the copying of password file is /tmp/$mytarget, where $mytarget is a variable.
* We know that the folder that holds the copy of the password file is fixed as /tmp, but the file name is the MD5 sum of the string "I am user bandit22", minus the space and dash characters at the end (not actually sure how the dash character came about during the hashing).
* However, this means that we are obtaining the password for the same level, bandit22. We want the password to the next level, bandit23.
* Thus, we copy the shell script contents to a self-created folder in /tmp, and modify $myname to bandit23. Save the file, change the permissions of the shell script to be executable for us, and then run the script.
* The MD5 sum is 8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349. Open /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 to get our password for the next level.
* Password for Level 23: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n

**Bandit Level 23 → Level 24**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to insert a shell script into an existing cron job.  
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.  
NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!  
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around...
* First, navigate to /etc/cron.d as mentioned and open cronjob_bandit24.
* Next, open cronjob_bandit24.sh in /usr/bin. From the shell script, we observe that what the script does is to execute and delete all scripts in /var/spool/bandit24 at every interval. (Because the level guide said that we had to "create" our first shell script, I thought that I had to fiddle with this one, but boy was I wrong - see below.)
* This is the **crucial** part that I had to understand - we could make use of this script to put in our own script which copies the password from /etc/bandit_pass to a directory of our choice.
* Thus, create a shell script in a directory of your choice under /tmp. Similar to Level 22, the idea is that we copy the password file from /etc/bandit_pass to our own directory, but with the help of a cron job. While it does technically count as creating your own shell script, I do not really think that that counts, because the script is virtually the same as the one used in the previous level.
* There are only 2 lines required in the script we create: #!/bin/bash and cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/<your_directory>/<your_file_name>. Set the script to be executable. All of the other lines are redundant - we do not actually require the print statement (which is only for debugging and learning purposes) nor the variables.
* Another crucial thing to do is to set /tmp/<your_directory> to be writeable by bandit24. This is because bandit24 will be running the shell script and the folder which we just created would not be originally writeable by other users. For convenience sake, I did a chmod 777.
* Copy this shell script to /var/spool/bandit24.
* Sit back and wait for a few minutes. Our shell script will be taken in by the spool, who will execute then delete it.
* The password is now sitting in /tmp/<your_directory>/<your_file_name>.
* Note: Using the same method of modifying $myname in Level 22 will not work. After the file has been copied to the /tmp directory, opening the file will not give the password, but "Yeah, that isn't going to work.  t. lucid" instead. I'm not sure how they made this message appear instead.
* I modified $myname to bandit25 and I got the password for Level 25. I guess the mechanism blocked the password for Level 24 from being revealed this way but not for other levels.
* In summary: Create a shell script that suits our purpose, and let this script be executed by the other user. Thus we have inserted ourselves into the cron job of the other user and hyjacked their permissions in such a way. 
* This was one of those levels that was really an eye-opener for me!
* Password for Level 24: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ

**Bandit Level 24 → Level 25**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to create a brute-forcing script, in conjunction with the nc command.  
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
* There is no hints given in this level's challenge in the sense that we had previously seen some commands which were proposed to be useful in solving the particular level's challenge, but not for this one. Nonetheless, we can say that what is required in this level is more of a combination of skills from the earlier challenges.
* Brute-forcing would mean that we require the use of a shell script (and this is truly our first test of creating our own shell script in my opinion, rather than the one mentioned in the previous level).
* We can use either nc (netcat) or telnet to establish a connection to port 30002.
* When I had first started off, I was wondering if it would be possible to establish a single conection and then run a script from within. This way, we would not have to repeatedly establish connections for each 4-digit attempt, to which there would be a limit on the number of connections that we can establish at any point in time. With this limitation, the brute-forcing process is likely to take longer. To date, I have yet to find a way to do this but another method which I had found had a workaround to this limitation of number of connections.
* We will work with the idea of establishing a connection for each 4-digit attempt. Thus, what we want is to execute nc localhost 30002 each time, and then send a string of the password for level 24 plus our 4-digit guess. This guess would have a range [0000, 9999].
* We will generate our 4-digit number using a for-loop (can be done with a while-loop as well).
* Thus, our shell script code is: for pin in 0000..9999; do; echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $pin | nc localhost 30002 >> result &; done. Create the shell script within our own directory in /tmp and set the shell script to be executeable.
* Credits go to https://blogcompsci.wordpress.com for this piece of code because I could not think of a way to speed up the brute-force process. The crucial part that does the fast-forwarding is the ampersand (&) symbol, which puts the nc process in the background so the next iteration can start, without having to wait for the current nc process to terminate, as pointed out by the author of that site.
* If we were to manually connect to 30002 and do a manual 4-digit attempt, we would realise that it takes awhile for the connection to timeout after our initial attempt. Having our shell script to automate launching one connection at a time takes way too long.
* I timed the duration required for the entire script (full range of 4-digit attempts) to run with the ampersand "hack" and it took only 25 minutes, and it would have been shorter if we set some condition to stop the script upon getting the correct one. Alas, we did not know what message would be printed even if we got the correct 4-digit pin.
* After the shell script is done running, the results of each attempt of brute-forcing was written to the file result. Most of what you see within is either the initial prompt by the pincode checker, the invalid attempt message, or the timeout message.
* I was surprised by the speed of the brute-forcing script because a stand-alone connection would take much longer to timeout, and it appears that the timeout of a connection when using the script was significantly shorter. Reason - not sure.
* There are around 6 tries being attempted at each short interval, from the print statements that I inserted and which were thus printed, as well as seen from the grouping of the 3 types of statements seen in the result file. This means that we can have around 6 simultaneous processes at any point in time (limit on the number of forked processes, I am guessing).

**Bandit Level 25 → Level 26**  
**Key Takeaways**: learn more about the intricacies of the more command, as well as the capabilities of a text editor.  
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
* After logging in to this level, we find that the SSH key to the next level is found in the current working directory. The old method (as used earlier in level 13) works: ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost, which is why it is said that the logging in is fairly easy. However, our connection is immediately closed after that.
* Recall in level 18 that we also had our connections similarly closed immediately after logging in, and we had to use a different shell to circumvent that problem. Let us try that method here: ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -t /bin/sh.
* We find that the huge wall of text is similarly not found when successfully logged in, but the connection is still terminated.
* Let's go back to reading the level goal and we see that a hint is to find out what the shell for user bandit26 is. A command for finding out the shell for a user is getent passwd <user> | cut -d : -f 7.
* We run the command with user bandit24 and bandit25 and we see that the output is /bin/bash. Running the command with user bandit26 gives the output /usr/bin/showtext. We find that the file is a shell script.
* The shell script shows that it sets the terminal to be of linux type (instead of the current xterm-256color), displays text.txt and then exits with status code 0. I was searching for the differences between the 2 terminal types to see if there was anything different but it turned out that I was looking at the wrong part of the shell script.
* The key to solving this level is to know the parameters of the more command, particularly the interactive commands, since we cannot modify the shell script to insert additional parameters. I saw the parameter !command, which executes a command in a subshell but that was not quite the correct one.
* We should be looking at the 'v' parameter, which starts up an editor at the current line. The point is to make the more command display part of the text.txt, and not the full thing, so that we can run our interactive command. To do so, we have to manually resize our terminal such that the entire text.txt cannot be displayed at one go.
* With that, we are able to use an editor which opens text.txt. We are not able to edit text.txt, and it would be quite pointless to do so since the shell script only opens and displays the file contents. Crucially, we are able to do things (that I did not know), from within a text editor.
* Type ":set shell=/bin/bash" (/bin/sh would also be fine), then press enter. Following that, type ":shell" and volia, we have our shell as user bandit26. I am guessing that since /bin/bash is not executed at login, the shell had not been set and thus the step is necessary. If we were to type ":shell" without the set command, the shell does not spawn for us.
* Alternatively, instead of getting a shell, we can just grab the password by entering ":e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26".
* I would not have cleared this level if not for https://kongwenbin.com. On hindsight, I should have realised that it had to do with the more command because that was the command just before exit 0, which we wanted to avoid.
